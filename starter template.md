# QE Testing Strategy Template

This document provides a reusable framework for defining and executing a Quality Engineering (QE) testing strategy. It is intended to promote alignment, ensure coverage, and support quality-driven delivery across all stages of a project.

---

## 1. Scope and Objectives

This section outlines the scope of testing at different levels, detailing how each level contributes to overall coverage and risk mitigation. It defines what will be tested, what won’t, and why it matters.

### 1.1 Testing Objectives
Clarifies what testing aims to achieve, including performance, security, and compliance goals.

### 1.2 In-Scope Features
Specifies the components and features that fall under active testing.

### 1.3 Out-of-Scope Features
Documents exclusions to manage expectations and prevent misalignment.

---

## 2. Approach and Methodology

Here, we describe the testing philosophy, how it fits into the overall development lifecycle, and which testing approaches will be applied. This helps anchor the entire QA effort in a clear direction.

### 2.1 Test Approach
Outlines the balance of automated vs. manual testing, and the chosen testing strategy (e.g., black-box, exploratory).

### 2.2 Testing Methodologies
Details which structured approaches (Agile, Waterfall, Risk-Based) will shape test execution.

---

## 3. Test Environment

A reliable test environment is critical to simulate real-world usage. This section describes how environments are set up, maintained, and aligned with testing goals.

### 3.1 Hardware and Software Configuration
Lists specifications and settings required for consistent test results.

### 3.2 Environment Setup and Maintenance
Describes the processes for provisioning and keeping test environments stable and up-to-date.

---

## 4. Risk Management

Every project has uncertainties—this section helps identify them early. By defining risks and how to mitigate them, we protect timelines and testing integrity.

### 4.1 Risk Identification
Pinpoints test-related risks such as unstable environments, unclear requirements, or tool limitations.

### 4.2 Risk Mitigation Strategy
Provides action plans and fallback options to reduce test disruption.

---

## 5. Test Schedule

This section lays out the testing timeline—from planning through post-release. By setting milestones and deadlines, teams can stay synchronized and avoid last-minute surprises.

### 5.1 Testing Phases and Milestones
Breaks down the test lifecycle into distinct phases with key delivery points.

### 5.2 Dependencies and Bottlenecks
Highlights potential roadblocks and outlines strategies to manage them effectively.

---

## 6. Test Deliverables

Testing is more than execution—it's about creating evidence. This section outlines what artifacts will be produced and when, supporting traceability and stakeholder reporting.

- Test Strategy Document  
- Test Plan  
- Test Cases / Scripts  
- Execution Logs  
- Defect Reports  
- Summary Reports  
- Interactive Dashboards

## 7. Roles and Responsibilities

Quality is a team effort. This section assigns accountability and ownership so that responsibilities are clearly understood and collaboration is streamlined.

| Role                 | Responsibility                                            |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Test Lead            | Oversees test planning and execution                      |
| QA Engineers         | Design and run tests; log and retest bugs                 |
| Automation Engineer  | Build and maintain test automation pipelines              |
| DevOps               | Manage environment provisioning and CI/CD support         |
| Project Manager      | Align testing with broader delivery objectives            |

---

## 8. Testing Metrics and Reporting

Measurement drives improvement. This section describes how quality and progress will be tracked, reported, and used to guide decisions.

### 8.1 Metrics
Defines which KPIs will be tracked (e.g., defect leakage, pass rates, test coverage).

### 8.2 Reporting Plan
Specifies how often results will be shared, in what format, and with whom.

---

## 9. Change Management

Things change—and testing needs to adapt. This section describes how updates to the system or test plans will be managed without compromising quality.

- Version control and branching strategies  
- Revalidation and regression testing plans  
- Audit trail and documentation of changes  

---

## 10. Exit Criteria

Knowing when to stop is just as important as knowing when to start. This section defines what must be achieved for testing to be considered complete.

- Critical and high-priority bugs resolved  
- Test cases executed with acceptable pass rate  
- Stakeholder approvals received  
- Non-functional benchmarks achieved  

---

## 11. Test Lifecycle & Task Management

This section breaks down how testing tasks are tracked from planning to post-release, ensuring that nothing falls through the cracks.

### 11.1 Task Breakdown
Outlines test-related activities like writing test cases, scripting, bug triage, and reporting.

### 11.2 Task Tracking Tools
Specifies tooling used (e.g., JIRA, Azure DevOps) and how task status will be managed.

---

## 12. Testing Types

Different testing types address different risks. This section clarifies which types will be used, why, and how they align with project goals.

| Type            | Purpose                                                        |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Functional       | Validate features behave as intended                          |
| Performance      | Ensure system meets speed and load requirements               |
| Security         | Identify vulnerabilities and verify access control            |
